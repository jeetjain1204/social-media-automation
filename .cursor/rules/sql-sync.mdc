description: Keep Supabase schema dump and types in sync after SQL edits
globs:
  - "supabase/schemas/**/*.sql"
  - "supabase/migrations/**/*.sql"
  - "**/*.sql"

After you edit or create any SQL or Supabase migration, immediately call the MCP tool `run-command` to run:
npm run db:sync

If it fails, surface stderr and suggest fixes. After success, include
supabase/schemas/schema.latest.sql and src/types/database.types.ts
in your next edit context.
